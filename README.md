## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TeamPulse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

1. **Role Switching**: Use the toggle button in the top-right corner to switch between Team Lead and Team Member views.

2. **Team Lead Features**:
   - View team status overview with counts and pie chart
   - Filter team members by status using the dropdown
   - Sort members by number of active tasks using the checkbox
   - Assign new tasks using the task form on the right

3. **Team Member Features**:
   - Update your status using the four status buttons
   - View your assigned tasks with progress bars
   - Use +10% and -10% buttons to update task progress
   - Tasks automatically complete at 100% progress

## Component Organization

Components are organized into logical folders for better maintainability:

- **layout/**: Core layout components (Header, Sidebar)
- **members/**: Member management and display components
- **tasks/**: Task creation and management components  
- **charts/**: Data visualization components
- **ui/**: Reusable UI elements and controls

Each folder includes an `index.ts` file for clean imports:
```typescript
import { Header, MemberCard, TaskForm } from '../components';
```

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes reflect immediately across the app
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with organized components
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal re-renders with Redux Toolkit and React.memo
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode with CSS custom properties

## Demo Data

The app uses the Random User API (https://randomuser.me/) to generate sample team member data on first load. This provides realistic names, emails, and avatars for demonstration purposes.

## Development Notes

### User Switching (Development)
For testing different user perspectives, use browser console:
```javascript
// Switch to Aanchal Saxena
window.store.dispatch({ type: "role/setUser", payload: "Aanchal Saxena"});

// Switch to John Smith  
window.store.dispatch({ type: "role/setUser", payload: "John Smith"});
```

### Code Quality Features
- **Memoized Components**: React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized Selectors**: useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Reusable Utilities**: Shared functions for common operations
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized folder structure with clear separation

## Future Enhancements

- Task filtering and search
- Due date notifications
- Team performance analytics
- Export functionality
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced user management
